                                    Course Wiz is a tool that helps UMSI students pick the right classes during registration. It strives to mitigate any anxiety and stress that a student might have during the process. The tool addresses the problems related lack of peer support, incomplete faculty profiles and missing course data.

                                <p>Students have to register for classes each semester. Being able to select the right classes is very important to students and is crucial to their academic success. However, the course selection process could be a difficult and stressful process. There are many classes offered by UMSI, permitting students the valuable freedom of choice. Yet, too many choices also makes it harder for a student to compile their schedule because they must consider a multitude of options and outcomes, while in some cases knowing little details about specific courses. I want to address these issues by developing a web application that gives UMSI students insights into crucial decision-making course details and background information that would help them pick appropriate courses with less efforts.</p>

                                    Iorio’s gelato makes authentic Italian gelato. They strive to make a genuine Italian gelato experience that includes the taste of the product,
                                    the design of the shop and the interaction between clients and staff. They want to make their customer’s lives more culturally rich by delivering the authentic
                                    Italian experience right in their town. They employ a fresh, modern approach to recreate the real Italian gelato. They utilize novel tools and knowledge, combined
                                    with using only real, natural and inspired by Italy ingredients. The goal of this project is to produce a
                                    recommendations report that the store owners could utilize to improve the customer experience.

                                    Iorio’s wants our team to find ways in which the customer service flow could be improved. They care about every step in the process, starting from when a
                                    customer walks into the store, until the time they leave. Aspects of particular importance include the process to get a gelato, the waiting, tasting and checkout. They
                                    want the whole experience to be aligned with and authentically inspired by the Italian mission of Iorio’s. They are not only interested in receiving good service flow
                                    tips, but also would like to see a spotlight on potential weaknesses in their process with respect to their Italian mission. They want us to look at both
                                    their locations in Ann Arbor, as well as in East Lansing. Another point of interest Iorio’s has is getting recommendations on how to preserve the Italian experience when
                                    expanding to potential new locations.

                                    which provided us with information about their history, current state and vision for the future.

                                        <li>Frozen Dessert Industry</li>

                                The report that I was responsible for was about the frozen dessert industry. The reports gave us insights into trends in the industry.
                                We wanted to get a good understanding of the relevant factors that might affect Iorios' performance.

                                    The purpose of this project is to investigate the feasibility, challenges, and opportunities to serve the
                                    underserved communities through shared connected vehicles with emerging information and communication technologies.
                                    We are studying two types of vehicle-and-service-sharing (V&SS) schemes which we refer as centralized and decentralized systems,
                                    and their benefits to underserved communities. The initial focus of the project is to pursue the centralized model.

                                    People living in underprivileged communities face transportation challenges. In such areas, public transportation is not available or unreliable.
                                    Vehicle-sharing services like Zipcar or Uber have open doors for great innovation in transportation via having people share vehicles and thus enable make transportation available to people without vehicles.
                                    However, such services have not spread out to underserved communities. We are investigating this problem and will propose a possible solution.

                                    In order to figure out details about out target audience, we looked at published literature on the subject, as well as data from Uber rides in the Detroit area.
                                    We looked into what the needs of the people in the underprivileged areas around Detroit are. Focus was given on which cities have poor access to public
                                    transportation and what are the common needs that people have.

                                    In order to get an understanding of the interactions and workflows involved in a ride-sharing application, I conduced a competitive analysis with popular centralized systems.

                                    we developed an anti-persona to help us stay on course with our design and not go off track.

                                    Our next steps are to interview stakeholders and gather more data. Additionally, we will be meeting with employees of community service centers in the area to gain

                                We investigate new methods, tools and technologies that enable users to interact with information in more natural and powerful ways, and
                                also make it easier for designers to create more usable and effective interfaces. Ultimately, our research will allow more users to become designers.
