                                Course Wiz is a tool that helps UMSI students pick the right classes during registration. It strives to mitigate any anxiety and stress that a student might have during the process. The tool addresses the problems related lack of peer support, incomplete faculty profiles and missing course data.

                            <hr />
                            <p>Students have to register for classes each semester. Being able to select the right classes is very important to students and is crucial to their academic success. However, the course selection process could be a difficult and stressful process. There are many classes offered by UMSI, permitting students the valuable freedom of choice. Yet, too many choices also makes it harder for a student to compile their schedule because they must consider a multitude of options and outcomes, while in some cases knowing little details about specific courses. I want to address these issues by developing a web application that gives UMSI students insights into crucial decision-making course details and background information that would help them pick appropriate courses with less efforts.</p>

                            <p>The discovery process involved talking to students in order to understand problems and concerns that they might have. Students told me that they have issues while trying to register for classes.</p>

                            <p>Once the problem definition was formed and the discovery phase was done, I conducted a competitive analysis, in order see if there are effective tools already addressing this issue. I identified the following competitors and alternatives to my potential solution: Koofers, MyEdu, RateMyProfessors and the UMSI Academic Advising.</p>

                            <p>I started brainstorming ideas in search of possible solutions. I started sketching possible approaches.
