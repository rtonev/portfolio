                                Autodesk Screencast is a tool that lets customers record their screens, in order to help others learn how to use Autodesk software. These videos can then be viewed by others using the Screencast video player, which allows users to also search and interact with the video. During our summer 2017 internship we redesigned Screencast, in order to make it accessible to customers who are deaf and hard of hearing. We accomplished that goal, as well as simplified the user interface, and added more business value to the product.

                            <p>Screencast is a great learning resource for Autodesk customers. However, it is not accessible for customers who are deaf or hard of hearing,
                                as it is not accessible to them. Automatic video transcription needs to be provided, in order to allow screencast creators to
                                easily make their recording accessbile to customers who are deaf or hard of hearing.</p>

                            <p>In order to get familiar with the product, we started by conducting heuristic evaluation and looked through existing research that the team had already documented.
                                We also went through the data that we can get through Google Analytics and the Autodesk Community Forums

                                To better understand our target population and user needs, we conducted interviews with Screencast users. The users varied in levels of experience with the app. We also interviewed some users were hard of hearing, as well as other that were not.

                                In order to get value out of the data that we collected, we synthesized it using an affinity map. We used the LUMA Institute exercise Rose, Thorn, Bud. This allowed us to better visualize the data, draw conclusions and get a sense of direction for our next steps.

                                Based on the ideas we came up with during brainstorming, we developed low-fidelity prototypes, which we used to have more discussions with more developed ideas. We reviewed each other's work and suggested changes.

                                We then created high-level prototypes using Framer. We picked that tool, because of its ability to produce highly interactive prototypes. We believed this was required for effectively testing a video player concept.

                                We tested our prototypes with 6 customers, 2 of which were deaf or hard of hearing. The test sessions included the following steps:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Intro</li>
                                    <li>Consent Form</li>
                                    <li>Pre-test questionnaire</li>
                                    <li>Testing Tasks</li>
                                    <li>Post-test questionnaire</li>
                                </ul>
                            </p>
                        </div>

                                Based on the feedback we got, we made changes to our prototypes and conducted a second usability testing session to verify that the new changes worked well.
                            </p>
                            <br />

                                Finally, we produced specifications documents that we shared with our team. We also presented our work to the team, as well as to our whole Global Customer Service & Operations division.
                                We also shared our interactive prototype, to clarify how the interactions would work.

                                We redesigned Screencast, to make it better and more useful to our customers. Here are the improvements over the old design:
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Accessibility</strong> - The new design is accessible to customers who are deaf or hard of hearing, because it includes a transcript and closed captions</li>
                                    <li><strong>Education</strong> - Since educational institutions are required to make their vido materials accessible to students who are deaf or hard of hearing, the new design is much more appropriate for educational use</li>
                                    <li><strong>Google SEO</strong> - Because the transcript is indexable by Google's bots, the videos would be much easier to find in Google searches </li>
                                    <li><strong>Search within Autodesk Knowledge Network</strong> - The transcript can also be fed into our search engine for better search results</li>
                                    <li><strong>Moderation</strong> - The transcript allows for automatically flagging profanities in the audio of videos, which makes moderation of the screencasts much easier</li>

                                </ul>
                                The next phase of the project is for the product team to scope the project, plan it, and for the developers to make the changes to the application.
