                                    The purpose of this project is to investigate the feasibility, challenges, and opportunities to serve the
                                    underserved communities through shared connected vehicles with emerging information and communication technologies.
                                    We are studying two types of vehicle-and-service-sharing (V&SS) schemes which we refer as centralized and decentralized systems,
                                    and their benefits to underserved communities. The initial focus of the project is to pursue the centralized model.

                                <p>
                                    People living in underprivileged communities face transportation challenges. In such areas, public transportation is not available or unreliable.
                                    Vehicle-sharing services like Zipcar or Uber have open doors for great innovation in transportation via having people share vehicles and thus enable make transportation available to people without vehicles.
                                    However, such services have not spread out to underserved communities. We are investigating this problem and will propose a possible solution.

                                    In order to figure out details about out target audience, we looked at published literature on the subject, as well as data from Uber rides in the Detroit area.
                                    We looked into what the needs of the people in the underprivileged areas around Detroit are. Focus was given on which cities have poor access to public
                                    transportation and what are the common needs that people have.

                                    In order to get an understanding of the interactions and workflows involved in a ride-sharing application, I conduced a competitive analysis with popular centralized systems.

                                    From the data that we gathered, we were able to produce personas that would represent our target audience. Additionally,
                                    we developed an anti-persona to help us stay on course with our design and not go off track.

                                    Our next steps are to interview stakeholders and gather more data. Additionally, we will be meeting with employees of community service centers in the area to gain
                                    more insights about general ternds and issues that our target population might have. The collected data will drive our prototypes and would help refine our personas and design ideas.
